                     --- Example 4 - ACTAR TPC --- 

Example to simulate and analyse experiment using the ACTAR TPC detector

1. SIMULATION
The simulation is using the special physics list in order to transport
the drift electron in the drift cage volume of ACTAR.
In the NPSimulation folder, you shoudl edit the PhysicsListOption.txt 
and the option DriftElectronPhyiscs should be set to 1 as follows:

		EmPhysicsList Option4
		DefaultCutOff 1
		DriftElectronPhysics 1


Other options should be set to 0.

To run the simualtion, do es follow in the NPSimulation folder:
> npsimulation -D Example4.detector -E Example4.reaction -O Example4

A gui will launch and type
/run/beamOn 10000 (for example) 
The simulation is slow due to the transport of the drift electrons and is
about 3 to 4 evt/sec

Example4.detector is loacted in Inputs/DetectorConfiguration and enable to 
choose the gas composition and the pressure for example. In this example 
we run with iC4H10 gas at 100 mbar.
It also allows us to add ancilary detector such as silicon detector at 
forward angle. This is the case is this example.

Example4.reaction is located in Inputs/Event generator and specify the 
event we want to simulate. In this example we simulate the elastic scattering
of a 18O entering in ACTAR a 59.4 MeV on a proton target.

The output root file is called Example4.root and will be located in Outputs/Simualtion

2. ANALYSIS
To analyse the simulated root tree compile the Example4 folder byt running
> cmake ./
then
>make

To run the analysis type in the Example4 folder:
> npanalysis -R RunToTreat.txt -O Example4

And output root file will be generated and located in Outputs/Analysis.
If one wants to see the fitted tracks will runnign the analysis, please make sure 
that the token in configs/ConfigActar.dat called RecoVisu is set to 1:
RecoVisu= 1
If this is the case run the hclient.C macro in another terminal's window.
A canvas should appear with the found tracks and their 3D fit.

3. MACRO
Sevaral root macro are located in Example4/macro to check the result of the analysis
and the obtained vertex, angular and energy resolution.
